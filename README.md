# Automation to create EC2 instance on AWS and start nginx server on it

Following information provides an automated solution to create EC2 instance on AWS and run nginx webserver on EC2.

## Requirements

* AWS account
* terraform v1.1.4
* ansible v2.12.1
* python v3.10.1

## Step 1
AWS initial steps
- Create IAM user on AWS account with the access of VPC, subnet, ec2, security groups.
- Get access key and secret key
- Create key pair to access ssh

## Step 2
Installation
- Install terraform on your local machine or one the ec2 instance using https://www.terraform.io/downloads
- Install ansible https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html
- Confirm all installation by checking their version

## Step 3
Terraform script to create infrastructure on AWS
- Create a file, provider.tf. This file stores the credentials to access AWS (check terraform/provider.tf file for reference)
- Create terraform resources file which creates AWS resources. (check terraform/resource.tf for refernece)
- resource.tf creates vpc, subnet, security group and ec2.
- run following command to init terraform
```bash
terraform init
```
- Above command will download aws plugin and initialize the terraform
- To check an execution plan
```bash
terraform plan
```
- It will show step by step the excution plan which will create resources
- To execute the plan
```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
```
- This will create resources on AWS

## Step 4
Creating Dockerfile and index.html (ref. docker/Dockerfile and docker/index.html)

## Step 5
Ansible script to deploy and run the nginx application on ec2
- Get the newly created ec2 public IP from step3
- Create inventory with custom hostname, ip, ansible user, and key to make ssh connection. (ref: ansible/inventory)
- Inventory hepls to connect to multiple instances
- To install initial packages on ec2 create a bash script (ref: ansible/install.sh)
- To create docker nginx image and run application container, create bash script (ref: start-docker.sh)
- Create ansible playbook yaml file which connect to ec2 instance, install all required packages using install.sh script, install docker, copy docker files and build and run the application (ref: deploy-nginx.yml)
```bash
ansible-playbook deploy-nginx.yml -i inventory
```

By using above steps, we can successfully create infrastructure on AWS, build the application using docker and deploy the application using ansible.
